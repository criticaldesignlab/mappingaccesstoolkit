# Mapping Access Toolkit
Participatory data collection, visualization, and social justice

## Who can use this toolkit? 
Anyone interested in understanding how to understand accessibility guidelines, collect information about accessibility in built environments, and share this information with others in accessible formats. 

If you are located in an educational institution, this toolkit has resources for: classroom teachers and professors, student groups, university administrators, and campus planners and architects. 

If you are not located in an educational institution, you can also use this toolkit for: collecting data about public spaces, organizing accessibility data for organizations, sharing directions and other forms of information with your friends and collaborators, and learning some basic tools for sharing spatial information. 

## How is this toolkit different from existing apps and tools? 
There are a variety of accessibility mapping tools available as smartphone applications. These are very good for quick collection of data according to pre-established criteria. However, this toolkit focuses on a different set of questions:
1. What counts as accessibility?
2. To whom?
3. Under what conditions? 
4. How do accessibility standards get created? What is their history? 
5. How do shifting social and material realities demand new frameworks for understanding accessibility?
6. Whose job is it to create accessibility? Where should accessibility resources come from?
7. Why are spaces that are accessible to some people not accessible to others? 
8. What solidarities form around accessible design? 
9. How should accessibility information be presented? 
10. What is a map? Must a map be visual? 

By asking these questions about accessibility, this toolkit will also guide you through a critical process for understanding the very concept of access differently.
